# 3D-RealismEvaluvation-MYS
Assignment 01_ Evaluating Realism of a Gaming Environment
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates creating a realistic 3D game scenario using Unity. The objective is to develop an immersive environment where a player-controlled character interacts with an AI-driven dragon, focusing on physical and behavioural realism.

### Key Features
- Realistic character movement and animations
- AI-driven dragon with patrol, chase, and attack behaviours
- Physics-based interactions with the environment and projectiles
- Detailed environment with interactive objects
- **Video Showcase**: Includes a video demonstration of the 3D realism aspects of the project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2022.3 or later
- A computer capable of running Unity
- Git (optional, for version control)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SandaruCooray/3D-RealismEvaluvation-MYS.git


2.  Open in Unity:
  Open Unity Hub
  Add the cloned project
  Open the project with Unity 2022.3 or later

Project Structure


Assets/: Game assets including scripts, models, and animations
Library/, Temp/, Logs/: Unity's local cache and temporary files (ignored by Git)
ProjectSettings/: Project-specific configurations
Packages/: Unity package manifest and dependencies
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git
README.md: This file
Video Showcase/: Contains a video demonstrating the 3D realism achieved in the project


3. Usage

3.1 Play the Game:

  Open the main scene in Unity
  Click the "Play" button
  
3.2 Character Controls:

  WASD or Arrow Keys: Move the character
  Spacebar: Jump
  Left Mouse Button: Shoot arrows
  Mouse Movement: Control the camera view
  
3.3 AI Interaction:

  Approach the dragon to trigger its behaviors such as patrolling, chasing, and attacking
  
4. Evaluation
  The project focuses on two primary areas of realism:

  Physical Realism: Evaluated through gravity, collision detection, and physics-based interactions
  Behavioural Realism: Evaluated through the AI-driven dragon's realistic responses to player actions
  
5. Video Demonstration
   
  A video showcasing the 3D realism aspects of the project is included in the Video Showcase/ folder.
